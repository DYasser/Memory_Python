# Memory_Python
One of my earliest projects when I was learning different languages.

In this algorithm the users are challenged to remember a list of numbers that are going to keep changing by players as the game goes on.

For example, let's imagine the first list being from 1 to 17 `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... ,16, 17]`. The player typing the last number is going to be able to change any list item by whatever he wants. 

Let's say the user typing the last number changes `3` with `cat`, the list becomes then `[1, 2, 'cat', 4, 5, ... ,16, 17]`.

## How to run

To get started you can `git clone  https://github.com/DYasser/Memory_Python.git` and have `Python3` installed. When you have `Python3` installed u can run the file pretty easily either by double clicking or by running it from an IDE.
