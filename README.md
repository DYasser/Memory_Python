Small algorithm that challenges players to remember a list of numbers, which each player is going to change as the game goes on.

The process is simple, the first player starts with the number 1, the next one with 2 and so on until they arrive at the 17th number where the player who wrote it can change the number's value to another one that the players need to take into concideration now.

imagine the first array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... ,16, 17]` when the player arrives at *17* he can change any value now so maybe he will change 3 to 'chopsticks' so the array becomes `[1, 2, 'chopsticks', ..., 17]` and if a the player with the 3rd turn doesn't remember what the number was changed to he loses. 

Simple fun game.
